Article-Level Metrics, is a Ruby on Rails application started by the [Public Library of Science (PLoS)](http://www.plos.org/). It stores and reports user configurable performance data on research articles. Examples of possible metrics are online usage, citations, social bookmarks, notes, comments, ratings and blog coverage.

Welcome to the Open Source project site!

Subsequent steps in this project will include expanding the number of data sources and adding online tools to help the most significant and relevant content to rise to the top.

We hope that Article-Level Metrics will become a powerful and transparent way of measuring the impact that individual articles have on the scientific and the wider community.

The application implements a rest interface to query for results in CSV, XML, JSON and JSONP formats. Here is an example of the application in use. This page queries ALM for the article statistics via JSONP and reports back the results inline:
